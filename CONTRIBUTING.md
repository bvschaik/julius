## Aim of the project

The aim of Julius is to re-create the exact same logic that the original Caesar 3 uses, with full savegame compatibility, but with user interface enhancements, like widescreen support. The same logic also means that any gameplay bugs present in Caesar 3 will also be present in Julius, like the 100-year-old ghosts.

Later on there may be an 'enhanced' edition with new features, but for now any pull requests which change the game logic will be declined.
