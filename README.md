Augustus is a fork of the Julius project that intends to incorporate gameplay changes.
=======
The aim of this project is to provide enhanced, customizable gameplay to Caesar 3 using project Julius UI enhancements.

Augustus is able to load Caesar 3 and Julius saves, however saves made with Augustus **will not work** outside Augustus.

Gameplay enhancements include:
- Roadblocks
- Market special orders
- Global labour pool
- Partial warehouse storage
- Increased game limits
- Zoom controls
- And more!

Because of gameplay changes and additions, save files from Augustus are NOT compatible with Caesar 3 or Julius. Augustus is able to load Caesar 3 save files, but not the other way around. If you want vanilla experience with visual and UI improvements, or want to use save files in base Caesar 3, check [Julius](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius).

Augustus, like project Julius requires the original assets (graphics, sounds, etc) from Caesar 3 to run.
It optionally [supports the high-quality MP3 files](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius/wiki/MP3-Support) once provided on the Sierra website.

## Running the game

First, download the game for your platform from the list above.

Alternatively, you can build Augustus yourself. Check [Building Julius](doc/BUILDING.md)
for details.

Then you can either copy the game to the Caesar 3 folder, or run the game from an independent
folder, in which case the game will ask you to point to the Caesar 3 folder.

Note that you must have permission to write in the game data directory as the saves will be
stored there.

See [Running](doc/RUNNING.md) for further instructions and startup options.
